# Game Name: Impact Trump Cards 

A major stumbling block for people new to impact mapping is misunderstanding impacts, and treating deliverables (mobile sales application) or user behaviour (buying) as impacts. The most effective way to capture impacts is with behaviour changes (buying _faster_), because that provides a dimension of measurement (_how much faster?_) and several possible ways of dividing the target into smaller targets (smaller scale of change, or change to a smaller segment of actors). 

The objective of this game is to promote divergent thinking and explicitly force teams to consider different ways stakeholders can impact the organisational objectives, inspiring groups to come up with a better definition of the problem before diving into designing a solution. 

People can often get a list of changes such as doing something faster, slower, more or less quickly. This game encourages them to go further. 

## Objective

Generate a list of potential impacts to consider for an impact map; secondary objective is to expand the list of stakeholders.

## Structure

This is an exercise for a small group (4-5) of participants. Larger groups of people can be split into several smaller groups, with a final discussion that brings all the results together.

This is a competitive game, in which points are awarded for creativity and thinking out of the box, similar to the classic card trump games. Each group should sit around a table (ideally cabaret style seating), and the participants simultaneously create playing cards, arrange them in stacks, and compete to collect stacks of cards. 

## Pre-requisites

This game requires the participants to have some knowledge about the goals of a product milestone or organisational initiative. It also requires the participants to have a basic idea about an initial sets of actors/stakeholders. Try creating a [Revenue Stream Map](../revenue-stream-map) as a preparation for this game.

The game also requires [pre-printed card templates](card-templates), that the participants can fill in. Although it's possible to play it with post-its and index cards, the template forces the participants to think about behaviour changes. Some cards are half-filled, with basic behaviour changes (such as faster, easier, slower), requiring people to think about behaviours only initially. Some cards are blank, letting the participants put in the changes as well. This is to help groups get started with the basics faster.

## Process

### Preparation

Hand out a batch of pre-printed card templates to each group. Encourage them to start filling in the blanks on half-filled cards first. Once they run out of half-filled cards, or when they get new ideas, they can start filling in the blank templates.

### First session - create initial cards

Time-box this to ten minutes, and ask the participants to create as many cards as they can, individually, and without discussion with others. The behaviour changes listed on the cards need to plausibly help or hinder the organisational initiative, and the participants have to be ready to explain/defend their choices.

### Trumping 

Each group chooses one person to start the game. The starting person chooses one of their cards and puts face up on the table, in the middle of the group, starting a new stack. The game continues clock-wise, with each person trying to trump the card currently on the top of the stack. 

* A card can be trumped by another card with the same stakeholder, but a different behaviour change. 
* A card cannot be played if the same behaviour change was already played in that stack
* User/stakeholder sub-segments are considered equivalent (so "European drivers", "Drivers" and "Truck drivers" are all going to the same stack)
* When a card is placed on the stack, the other group participants can challenge if the behaviour change can have an impact. The group can vote to reject the card, if the impact is not plausible/realistic.
* One player can only place one card at a time, the next player clockwise plays after.
* If a participant does not have any cards that can trump the current top of the stack, the next participant plays. 

When no participants have any additional cards, the last person to place the card on top of the stack wins the whole stack, and one point. The winning player then moves the stack to the side,  and can start a new stack by placing a card with a new stakeholder face up. 

The game continues until there are no new cards to place.

The participants are allowed to create new cards as the game continues, as long as they don't hold up the game -- so the best time to add new cards is while the others are playing their cards and during discussions. This is to support divergent thinking.

### Rounds

If the group runs out of cards, they can play another round, time-boxing the creation of initial cards and trumping again, but making sure to avoid duplicates from the earlier rounds.

### Points at the end

The purpose of "winning" the stack in the game is to add a competitive element which will promote divergent thinking and speed up the game, but it may also be nice to declare a final winner at the end and award a symbolic trophy, such as a chocolate bar. 

###Â Coordinating discussion

Draw up a set of quadrants on a big sheet of paper, or a whiteboard, and get the group to cluster and organise ideas. This is the convergent part of the exercise, where the group discards duplicates and chooses the first set of impacts to deal with. 

The horizontal axis should reflect how much a behaviour change can help or hinder the initiative (eg left side for obstructions, right side for helpful behaviour changes, and distance from the centre reflects expected magnitude of impact).  

The vertical axis reflects how quickly the impact can be observed (soon or late).
