# Impact Trump Cards - player guide

The Impact Trump Cards game is designed to help you think of more impacts and come up with a wider range of ideas to explore for an impact map. 

## Objective 

This is a competitive game, in which points are awarded for creativity and thinking out of the box.

The objective of the game is to get as many points as possible. The players compete by placing cards on top of other cards, forming stacks. The player who places the top-most card on the stack wins one point. 

## How to play

The game is designed for 4-5 players, and each game round has two parts -- writing cards and trumping.

### Writing cards

This part should be time-boxed to 10 minutes. The players write down impacts on blank cards, without discussion in the group.

* Create as many cards as you can.
* Make sure you've clearly defined the actor/stakeholder and the behaviour *change*
* Make sure you can explain and defend why that behaviour change can plausibly help or hinder the organisational initiative

### Trumping cards

In this part, the players use their cards to form stacks.

#### Starting the first stack

* Choose one person to start the trumping cycle. 
* That player takes one of their cards, and places it face-up on the table, starting a new stack.

#### Playing a stack 

The players take turns clock-wise, with each person trying to trump the card currently on the top of the stack. 

* A card can only be trumped by another card with the same (or closely related) actor/stakeholder/user segment, but a different behaviour change.
  * All the actor/stakeholder sub-segments are considered equivalent (so "European drivers", "Drivers" and "Truck drivers" are all going to the same stack)
  * The importance or magnitude of impact is not important for trumping -- any card with a related actor/stakeholder can trump another card
  * A card cannot be used if the same *behaviour change* was already played in that stack. 
* When a card is placed on the stack, the other group participants may challenge it.
  * The player who proposed the card needs to explain why the behaviour change helps or hinders the overall objective
  * The rest of the group votes to accept or reject the card
  * If the impact is not plausible/realistic, the group should reject it.
* One player can only place one card at a time, the round continues with the next player clockwise.
* If a player does not have any cards that can trump the current top of the stack,  the round continues with the next player clockwise.
* Trumping ends when no players have any additional cards to trump the top-most card on the stack.
* _The participants are allowed to create new cards as the game continues, as long as they don't hold up the game_ 
  * try writing new cards while the others are playing their cards and during discussions. 
* Once no players have any more cards to trump a stack, the last person that placed a card there wins one point.

### Starting a new stack

**VARIANT A**:

* Any player can start a new stack when it's their turn to play, by placing a card face-up next to the existing stacks. 

**VARIANT B**: 

* Only one stack can be active at any point
* When nobody can trump a stack any more, the player who won that round can start a new stack with one of their cards. 
* If they have no additional cards to start a new stack, the next player clockwise can start the stack, and so on

### Ending the game

* The game continues until there are no new stacks to start or cards to place
