# Concerts Online

Hands-on, interactive educational workshop, suitable for groups of up to 30-40 participants. Designed to teach the key ideas and basic technique of impact mapping. Great for a half-day or a full-day conference session, or as part of a larger educational workshop.

This is a workshop that Gojko Adzic and colleagues from Neuri Consulting ran for several years at various conferences, including Product Owner Survival Camps.  As of early 2016, more than two thousand people went through a variant of this workshop, so it's battle-tested. It's interactive and well paced to provide a solid introduction, motivating the participants for further study and research. 

## Intended audience

Product managers working in iterative delivery, product owners working with agile/lean teams, senior technical people delivering software iteratively, agile coaches, Scrum masters working with teams transitioning to iterative delivery

## Key learning outcomes

* how to capture value for iterative delivery/user stories on several levels
* how to align stakeholders with competing priorities
* how to avoid user story stream of consciousness (anything goes) and water-scrum-fall (nothing can be released quickly)
* how to create roadmaps so that teams get the most out of iterative delivery
* how to report progress on value, not just effort
* how to prioritise based on value, not complexity
* how to slice stories so that they are small but valuable, and aligned with business vision

## Prerequisites

The participants should have the basic knowledge of iterative delivery (eg working with user stories).
