# Facilitation guide

This guide explains how to facilitate the 'Concerts Online' impact mapping educational workshop. It is intended for consultants, trainers and team leaders that want to introduce an impact mapping into an organisation. This is not a guide for participants. See the [Logistics Guide](logistics-guide.md) for information regarding participant documents.

## Workshop variants

This workshop can run either as a half-day or a full-day session. The half-day variant is faster paced and better as a motivational session. The full-day variant allows for more time for discussion and several additional exercises, so it is better for people looking for more hands-on experience. You can run this workshop as a separate session, or include it into a larger workshop (for example, a two-day product owner course). If you decide to mix this with educational sessions on other techniques, it should come ideally after a session on determining business objectives/goals and before a session on detailed user stories or techniques to deal with individual backlog items.

The half-day session requires relatively punctual timing, especially for group discussions, so you'll have to lead the groups a bit to the right conclusions quickly. The key points that the participants are supposed to reach are listed in the exercise guides. 

In the full-day variant you should let the discussions go on for longer, and may potentially remove the last exercise if the schedule slips. 

### Half-day guideline timings

For illustrative purposes, this assumes that the workshop starts at 9AM. Adjust accordingly for an afternoon session.

## Group considerations

The participants will work in groups, straight from the start. The ideal group size is 4-5 participants. Avoid larger groups as they tend to create too much internal discussion, and it's easy for some people to tune out in a larger group. Ideally, mix people so that people who typically work together aren't in the same group - get a mix between teams, or in case of a public workshop, a mix between different organisations.  For a half-day variant, let the people stay in the same group whole time. For the full-day variant, consider shuffling groups between exercises to allow for more varied opinions and break monotony. 

With less than 20 people in the room (so 3-4 groups), you can run discussion sessions by getting each group to present their work in turn. With more groups, this will take too much time. Instead of each group presenting, give people five minutes at the start of each discussion session to walk around the room and see the results produced by other groups, then lead the discussion by pointing out the key ideas on various solutions.
